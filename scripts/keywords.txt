Absorb	**Absorb X:** A layered ability activated during the Damage Prevention play or pass chance that means, "Prevent up to X damage to this unit, and it gains power for its next attack equal to the amount of damage prevented this way."
Accuracy	**Accuracy X/-X:** A cumulative, static ability that means, "Add X to each of this unit's attack dice." and "Subtract X from each of this unit's attack dice." respectively. Accuracy can't alter "natural" rolls to affect Backfire, Critical Hit, Focus, Fury, Parry, or Riposte, but it can affect your chance against Armor. If a unit gets the Accuracy ability after you roll attack dice, it's too late to affect the hits.
Adapt	**Adapt: [First/Second/Third... effect]** A layered static ability that means "When this arena's battle step starts, choose one of game text separated by slashes. This unit gets the chosen game text until end of turn."
Alternative Cost	**Alternative Cost: [cost]:** A selective, static effect that means, "Instead of paying the build cost of this card, you may complete this card by paying the [cost] listed." Alternative Cost must be paid in full, if it is not possible to pay the [cost] completely, you can't complete the card. You must pay the [cost] in the order listed. Any ability that reduces the normal cost to complete a card does not reduce the [cost] in that card's Alternative Cost, unless the ability specifically says so.
Ambush	**Ambush X:** A layered, activated ability that means, "If your opponent deploys, moves, or puts a unit into this arena, this unit does X dice of damage to that unit." Each Ambush can be used once per instance of a unit being deployed, moved, or put.
Area Damage	**Area Damage X:** A cumulative, triggered ability that means, "Whenever damage from this unit's attack causes a unit to be discarded, this unit may do X dice of damage to another unit in the same arena as the discarded unit."
Armor	**Armor:** An isolated, static ability that means, "This unit can only be hit on a roll of 5 or more." Armor works against dice of damage and attack dice. It redefines what die roll is required to hit a unit. It doesn't modify the die roll like Accuracy. A unit with Accuracy 1 attacking a unit with Armor hits with 4's, 5's, and 6's.
Avenge	**Avenge X:** A cumulative, triggered ability that means, "Whenever damage from an attacking unit causes one of your other units in the same arena as this unit to be discarded, this unit does X dice of damage to the attacking unit when the attack ends."
Backfire	**Backfire X:** A cumulative ability triggered by the initial dice roll that means, "When you roll at least one natural three with this unit's attack dice before reroll, this unit does X dice of damage to itself when the attack ends." Backfire applies only to dice rolled for an attack, not to dice rolls for abilities like Retaliate.
Barrage	**Barrage X:** A cumulative, static ability that means, "This unit may attack a unit in the Character arena instead of this arena, using X power plus any other effects." You choose whether to use Barrage to attack a unit in the Character arena or to make an attack in the arena your unit is in. You can't attack a unit in the Space or Ground arena using Barrage. Power changes affect Barrage including those granted by stacking.
Bombard	**Bombard X:** A cumulative, static ability that means, "This unit may attack a unit in the Ground arena instead of this arena, using X power plus any other effects." You choose whether to use Bombard to attack a unit in the Ground arena or to make a normal attack in the arena your unit is in. You can't attack a unit in the Space arena using Bombard. Power changes affect Bombard including those granted by stacking.
Bounty	**Bounty: [bonus]:** A layered ability triggered during a unit discard that means, "When another unit is discarded by damage from this unit, you gain the following when your next build step starts." Bounty triggers even if the attacking unit leaves play. Bounty works in the build zone. You will gain the bounty even if the attacking unit is sent to the discard pile. The unit can't collect a bounty on itself.
Consume	**Consume:** An isolated, static ability that means "This unit gets +10 speed, +1 power, and +1 health for each face-down card beneath it. Whenever damage from this unit causes another unit to be discarded, put the top card of its stack face-down beneath this unit."
Critical Hit	**Critical Hit X:** A cumulative ability triggered during the pending damage step that means, "If you rolled at least one natural six with this unit's attack dice, this unit does X more damage for this attack." Only one natural "6" counts in the attack roll after rerolls. If a unit gets the Critical Hit ability after you roll attack dice, it's too late to affect the damage. Accuracy can't increase the die roll to a natural "6". However, you or your opponent may use an effect to reroll dice to affect the number of natural sixes. (You only count the six, if any, from the roll used for the attack.) Critical Hit applies only to dice rolled for an attack, not to dice rolls for abilities like Retaliate.
Cunning	**Cunning:** An isolated, static ability that means, "Roll this unit's attack dice secretly. Show them to your opponent after damage prevention." If a player can't roll the attack dice secretly, perform the Damage Prevention POP chance before rolling attack dice. When the attacking unit has Cunning there will always be a damage prevention play or pass chance, even if no pending damage is created by the attack.
Damage Control	**Damage Control X:** A cumulative, triggered ability that means, "When your build step starts, you may remove up to X damage counters from this unit."
Deflect	**Deflect X:** A layered ability activated during the damage prevention POP that means, "Prevent X damage to this unit, and this unit may do that much damage to a unit of your choice in the same arena." Deflect creates new damage that can be done to any unit in the same arena as the unit that activated Deflect (even itself). Deflect may be deflected any number of times. Damage is applied after all prevention and deflects resolve. The damage that the unit does equals the damage it prevented. You can play each Deflect effect only once for each source of damage. Deflect as much damage as you can up to the Deflect value.
Deploy	**Deploy: [Effect]:** When you deploy this unit, gain the listed effect.
Double Damage	**Double Damage:** An isolated, static ability played during the damage placement POP that means, "Put 1 additional damage counter on the defending unit for each 1 damage that wasn't prevented." Damage counters placed by a unit with Double Damage are in addition to the counters that would be placed normally if the attacking unit did not have Double Damage.
Double Strike	**Double Strike:** An isolated, static ability played after the attack end POP that means, "You may choose an opponent's unit that this unit can attack. This unit attacks that unit. Play only if this unit just attacked and only if it tapped for that attack." The unit must tap for the first attack, not the second. If it untaps, it may double strike again. Double Strike doesn't allow you to attack your own units.
Elude	**Elude:** (Renamed to Precision.) An isolated, static ability that means, "When this unit attacks the defending unit can't be changed from the chosen target." An attacking unit with Precision cannot have the target of its attack changed by a unit with the Intercept, Redirect, or any other effect. "Elude" is the former name of this keyword. Treat any unit with Elude as if it has Precision instead.
Enhance	**Enhance: [Effect]:** A selective, static effect that means, "You may play the following effect by paying the additional cost." The effect states whether you play it "instead" or "also". You must declare it to get its effect and you must pay it before any effects resolve and before the Disrupt play or pass chance.
Equip	**Equip:** A selective effect on Equipment activated during the build step that means, "Attach this Equipment to a card with a type that matches one of this Equipment's subtypes. Play only during your build step." You can pay the Equip cost only once per turn.
Evade	**Evade X:** A layered ability activated during the damage prevention POP that means, "Prevent up to X damage to this unit." You can play Evade only once for each instance of damage. You don't have to use all of the Evade. You choose how much damage to Evade up to X, even if the full amount of damage or more is pending.
Ferocity	**Ferocity:** An isolated, static ability that means, "Damage from this unit can't be prevented." Damage that can't be prevented includes all damage coming from the unit with Ferocity, including damage from attacks, Ambush, Deflect, Retaliate, and other effects that specify the source of damage as the unit with Ferocity. Units with Fortitude override this ability, and can prevent damage to themselves from units with Ferocity.
Focus	**Focus X:** A cumulative ability triggered by the initial dice roll that means, "When you roll at least one natural five with this unit's attack dice before reroll, this unit gets +X power for its next attack." Only the first natural "5" counts. A five rolled after reroll doesn't matter. Focus applies only to dice rolled for an attack, not to dice rolls for abilities like Retaliate. Accuracy can't increase the die roll to a natural "5." The bonus power only lasts for one attack, but it can be triggered again each attack.
Foresight	**Foresight: [Effect]:** A static, layered effect that means, "Whenever this unit attacks, you may predict the number of hits that will be rolled for that attack. If you're correct, gain the [effect]." For example, a unit with "Foresight: Gain 2 Force" will give you 2 Force if you guess the number of hits rolled correctly.
Forewarning	**Forewarning: [Effect]:** A static, layered effect that means, "Whenever this unit is attacked, you may predict the number of hits that will be rolled for that attack. If you're correct, gain the [effect]. For example, a unit with "Forewarning: Gain 2 Force" will give you 2 Force if you guess the number of hits rolled correctly.
Fortitude	**Fortitude:** An isolated, static ability that means, "This unit can prevent unpreventable damage to itself." Units with Fortitude can prevent damage from units with Ferocity and "damage... that can't be prevented" by using Deflect, Evade, Parry, and other damage prevention abilities. Fortitude only allows a unit to prevent unpreventable damage to itself, not to other units. Putting damage counters directly on a unit is not the same thing as doing damage, and also can't be stopped by Fortitude.
Fury	**Fury X:** A cumulative ability triggered by the initial dice roll that means, "When you roll at least one natural four with this unit's attack dice before reroll, roll X additional attack dice." Only the first natural "4" counts. A four rolled after reroll doesn't matter. If your unit gets the Fury ability after you roll attack dice, it's too late to roll additional attack dice. Fury applies only to dice rolled for an attack, not to dice rolls for abilities like Retaliate. Accuracy can't increase the die roll to a natural "4."
Hidden Cost	**Hidden Cost X:** A selective, static effect that means, "As long as you have a number of build counters on this card equal to X or the card's current build cost (whichever is less), you may complete it anytime by paying Force for the remaining build cost, if any." Hidden Cost can only be played if the card is partially built and has the required number of build counters on it. Effects and stacking rules may reduce the build cost required to complete the card and may even reduce the cost beneath the X value. You do not need to pay Force if there are enough build counters on the card to complete the card. You may use Hidden Cost anytime, except during any Play-or-Pass chances reserved for reroll, damage prevention, or disrupt POP chances. You may not use Hidden Cost to deploy a Pilot to a unit.
INSERT	**INSERT:** A layered, static ability that means, "When this card is the top card of a stack, or stacked under the top card, the top card gets the following effect;" Insert works while in the build zone. The effect works while anywhere in the stack. The granted effect remains to be the effect of its type. (For example, activated abilities granted by Insert may be disrupted.) While the INSERT effect itself (the ability to grant the listed effect to the top card of the stack from anywhere in the stack) works when the stacked card is in the build zone, the effect listed as being granted by INSERT will only work per the normal rules of the game and will only work in the build zone if the granted effect would work in the build zone.
Inspiration	**Inspiration:** An isolated, static ability that means, "Each of your other units in this arena gets +10 speed, +1 power, and +1 health." A non-unique card cannot have Inspiration.
Intercept	**Intercept:** A selective ability activated during the attack POP that means, "If one of your other units is being attacked in the same arena, the attacking unit now attacks this unit instead." Intercept doesn't end the attack. Any number of units may intercept an attack once for each instance of the effect. Each intercepting unit has been attacked. Intercept isn't a prevention ability. Intercept doesn't cause a new attack. (It is the same attack.) Your unit may intercept an attack from one of your own units (but not from itself) as long as the unit that activates Intercept can be attacked by the attacking unit. If the attacking unit can't attack the intercepting unit, you can still pay the activation cost for Intercept, but the defending unit won't change. "For this attack" effects do not trigger for each Intercept. Some effects may end because they don't apply to the new defending unit unless the effect's conditions are met by the new defending unit. An effect that addresses the attack can't be played for each intercept, but could continue.
Intimidation	**Intimidation:** An isolated, static ability that means, "This unit gets +10 speed, +1 power, and +1 health for each of your opponent's units in this arena." A non-unique unit cannot have Intimidation.
Ion Cannon	**Ion Cannon X:** A cumulative, static ability that means, "This unit may attack a unit in the Space arena instead of this arena, using X power plus any other effects." You choose whether to use Ion Cannon to attack a unit in the Space arena or to make a normal attack in the arena your unit is in. You can't attack a unit in the Ground arena using Ion Cannon. Power changes affect Ion Cannon including those granted by stacking.
Last Stand	**Last Stand: [Effect]:** When this unit is discarded from any arena, gain the listed effect.
Lucky	**Lucky X:** A cumulative, static ability that means, "Each time this unit attacks or is attacked, you may reroll up to X of this unit's attack dice or have your opponent reroll up to X attack dice against this unit." Both players can use Lucky effects according to the rules for POP chances. Lucky is used only once after all triggered reroll effects resolve. You can't reroll more dice than are rolled for the attack. You may choose to roll any number of dice up to the Lucky value.
Meditate	**Meditate:** An isolated activated effect that means, "You may play this card from your discard pile without paying the printed build, Force, or alternate cost. When a card that was played using Meditate would be discarded, remove it from the game instead." Meditate can only be activated when the card is in your discard pile. Battle cards can only have Meditate activated when that Battle card would normally be played. Trap cards can only have Meditate activated when the triggering condition for that Trap card is met. All other cards can only have Meditate activated during your build step. Paying the Meditate activation cost means you don't pay the normal printed cost of the card.
Overkill	**Overkill:** An isolated ability triggered during the pending damage POP that means, "When this unit attacks, you may divide hits in excess of the defending unit's remaining health between that unit and another unit in the same arena." The player who controls the attacking unit decides how many hits (if any) in excess of the defending unit's remaining health to reassign as damage to the second unit. (That player can't change their mind afterward.) A number of hits equal to the defending unit's health must be assigned to the defending unit, and the remainder may be assigned to the defending unit or another unit in the same arena. Overkill damage is caused by the ability, not the die roll. Shields, Parry, and Armor have no effect against it, but damage prevention not specifying dice works normally. Both units resolve damage in tandem.
Overload	**Overload X:** A cumulative, static ability that means, "When this unit attacks, you may give it +X power for that attack. If you do, it does X dice of damage to itself when the attack ends."
Parry	**Parry X:** A cumulative ability triggered during the damage prevention POP that means, "If the attacking unit rolled at least one natural '1' against this unit, prevent up to X damage to this unit." Only one natural "1" is counted from the attack roll after rerolls. Parry doesn't prevent damage from a parrying unit unless it attacks itself. Parry can't affect unpreventable damage. If a unit gets the Parry ability after you roll attack dice, it's too late to affect the damage. Accuracy can't decrease the die roll to a natural "1". However, you or your opponent may use an effect to reroll dice to affect the number of natural ones. (You only count the 1, if any, from the roll used for the attack.) Parry applies only to dice rolled for an attack, not to dice rolls for abilities like Retaliate.
Persuade	**Persuade X:** A layered ability activated during the Damage Prevention POP that means, "Prevent up to X damage to this unit, and the attacking unit, if any, loses power for its next attack equal to the amount of damage prevented this way."
Pilot	**Pilot:** A layered, static ability written as ">o< [subtype] Pilot. The [subtype] gets:… ." that means, "You may move this card onto or off of a non-Droid unit of the correct subtype once during the build step. Ignore all other text on this card except its name, subtype and health. The piloted unit can only be piloted by the number of Pilots that its subtype allows." Treat all of a unit's Pilot abilities for a subtype as a single Pilot ability for that subtype. It grants abilities to that unit alone. (See Pilots, for more details.)
Precision	**Precision:** An isolated, static ability that means, "When this unit attacks the defending unit can't be changed from the chosen target." An attacking unit with Precision cannot have the target of its attack changed by a unit with the Intercept, Redirect, or any other effect. "Elude" is the former name of this keyword. Treat any unit with Elude as if it has Precision instead.
Protect	**Protect X:** A layered ability activated during the damage prevention POP that means, "Prevent up to X damage to one of your other units in this arena." You can play Protect only once for each instance of damage. You don't have to use all of the Protect. You choose how much damage to Protect up to X, even if the full amount of damage or more is pending. If a card that activated the Protect ability leaves the arena as part of the cost to activate that Protect ability, treat that card as if it were still in that arena until the Protect ability resolves.
Redirect	**Redirect:** A selective, activated ability that means, "If this unit is attacked, choose one of your other units that can be attacked and damaged in this arena and does not have an ability that automatically prevents all damage to it. The attacking unit attacks the chosen unit instead." Note: An attacking unit with Precision will mean Redirect will have no effect during that attack.
Reduced Cost	**Reduced Cost X: [condition]** A selective, static effect that means, "This card's cost is X if the listed condition is met." Reduced Cost on cards refers to the build cost, except for Battle cards, where it refers to the Force activation cost. For this keyword, the conditional statement will always start with "If" for clarity. The condition must be met in order for you to be able to pay the "Reduced Cost." *Example: One of your cards has "Reduced Cost 6: If you have a unit in the Space arena." You must have a unit in the Space arena in order to deploy the unit using the Reduced Cost of 6 build counters. Note: Other effects and stacking rules may further decrease the build cost. In the previous example, you might have another effect which causes that same card to cost "1 less build counter to deploy." Therefore, you can deploy that card as long as it has at least 5 build counters on it (6 - 1 = 5).*
Reserves	**Reserves: [Ability]:** A layered, static ability that means, "The following ability works while, and only while, it's in the build zone." The granted ability remains to be the ability of its type. (For example, activated abilities granted by Reserves may be disrupted.)
Resilience	**Resilience +/- 'X':** A cumulative, static ability that means, "As long as this unit has at least 'X' damage counters on it, that unit's power is modified by +/- 'X'." As you cannot have negative damage counters on a unit, the cumulative numeral of 'X' always refers to the number of damage counters on the unit. Effects that provide a + Resilience may be written simply as 'Resilience 1' instead of 'Resilience +1'. If the cumulative Resilience 'X' is a positive number that unit gets + 'X' power. If the cumulative Resilience 'X' is a negative number that unit gets - 'X' power.
Retaliate	**Retaliate X:** A layered ability activated during the attack POP that means, "If a unit in the same arena as this unit is attacking this unit, this unit does X dice of damage to that unit when the attack ends." A Retaliate ability without an activation cost has a printed cost of "Pay 0 Force §". Retaliate resolves when the attack ends, even if your unit gets discarded. Retaliate dice are just dice of damage, not attack dice, and can trigger Stun. Retaliate based on a unit's power is based on its total power at the time the Retaliate is activated. Retaliate doesn't work with attacks from another arena (such as Bombard and Ion Cannon) or the build zone. A unit may retaliate against itself if it attacks itself. Each Retaliate may be used once per attack. Each defending unit can activate Retaliate during the attack POP, which resolve in their order when the attack ends, even if the retaliating unit is discarded.
Riposte	**Riposte X:** A cumulative ability triggered by the roll of a natural two during an attack that means, "If the attacking unit rolled at least one natural two against this unit, this unit does X damage to it when the attack ends." Only one natural "2" is counted from the attack roll after rerolls. Negative Accuracy can't decrease the die roll to a natural "2". However, you or your opponent may use an effect to reroll dice to affect the number of natural twos. (You only count the 2, if any, from the roll used for the attack.) Riposte applies only to dice rolled for an attack, not to dice rolls for abilities like Retaliate.
Shields	**Shields X:** A cumulative, static ability that means, "The attacking unit gets –X power against this unit." Shields only matters when attack dice are rolled. If you give a unit Shields after your opponent has rolled for damage, it doesn't affect the roll.
Stack	**Stack: [List]:** A layered, static ability that means "You may put a listed card under this unit as part of its stack." The listed cards can't be on top of the stack. Cards with the Stack ability don't count as the cards listed and don't contest with any of the listed cards. If a card is listed by its name you can't stack a card with a different name unless it satisfies a different criteria in the [list] or they represent the same unit. (See Different Versions with Different Names) Unlike a normal stack, you can only have one version of each unique unit from the [list] in the stack. Non-unique cards listed on a card with the Stack ability are permitted to form a part of the stack and you can have multiple cards with the same name in the stack as long as they are non-unique. Cards added to a card's stack using the Stack ability cannot exceed the 4 card maximum normal stacking rule. If a unique card with the Stack ability loses that Stack ability, or is longer the top card of the stack, immediately remove any cards from the stack that can't be stacked with the current top card of the stack and put those cards in their owner's discard pile.
Stealth	**Stealth:** An isolated, static ability that means, "This unit can't be attacked unless it's tapped or has damage counters on it." An untapped and undamaged unit with Stealth can still be affected by alternative types of damage. (Such as Overkill.) As long as the unit has any number of damage counters on it, it can't use Stealth and can now be attacked. A unit with Stealth can activate its own Intercept ability, but will not become the defending unit unless it has at least 1 damage counter on it or it is tapped, or the attacking unit has the ability to attack stealth units for some other reason. Units can't gain Stealth after Velocity has already triggered and the change in speed is already in effect.
Stun	**Stun X:** A cumulative ability triggered during the damage placement POP that means, "When this unit damages another unit, that unit gets –X power until end of battle." If no damage counters are placed as a result of damage, Stun doesn't occur. Stun works anytime the unit damages another unit, not just when it attacks. Only the unit with both Deflect and Stun abilities can stun when it activates its Deflect.
Surge	**Surge X:** A cumulative ability triggered during the damage placement POP that means, "Whenever another unit damages this unit, you may give a unit of your choice in this arena +X power until end of turn." If no damage counters are placed as a result of damage, Surge doesn't occur. Surge works any time another unit is the source of damage, not just during attacks. You can choose any unit in the same arena as the unit with Surge to be the recipient of the +X power, including itself and even your opponent's units.
Switch	**Switch:** [First/Second/Third unit type effect]: A layered, static ability that means, "As long as this unit is in the first arena listed on its type line, it gets the effects listed to the left of the first slash. As long as this unit is in the second arena listed on its type line, it gets the effects listed to the right of the first slash. As long as this unit is in the third arena listed on its type line, if any, it gets the effects listed to the right of the second slash, if any." If it says "None" as one of the arena type's effects, it means that it gets no extra effects while in that arena. The unit's Switch effects will correspond to the types listed on the unit's type line. There won't be a slash for an arena not listed in the unit's type. Switch doesn't allow units to change arenas during the battle phase.
Tenacity	**Tenacity X:** A cumulative ability triggered after damage placement that means, "Whenever this unit does less than X damage, after damage prevention, for its first attack each turn, it may attack the same target again without tapping."
Upkeep	**Upkeep: [Cost]:** A layered ability triggered when the build step starts that means, "When the build step starts each turn, you must pay the following cost." You must choose one of the costs that you can pay each turn, and ignore the others. You must still pay the Upkeep costs of a unit even if that unit is in the build zone, becomes the top card of a unique unit stack, or Pilots another unit. The Upkeep must be paid if you can pay it. If you can't pay any of the listed costs in full, then ignore Upkeep. If a unit has multiple instances of Upkeep abilities, fulfilling just one of the Upkeep abilities (such as tapping the unit) does not satisfy all the Upkeep costs at once; it would only satisfy that instance of Upkeep. You may choose the order of multiple Upkeep abilities to keep an Upkeep from being paid, though a different order might pay it.
Velocity	**Velocity X:** A selective static ability triggered at the start of the arena battle step that means, "When this arena's battle step starts, you may give this unit +X speed until end of turn. If this unit doesn't have Stealth, you may give it -X speed until end of turn instead." Velocity only triggers if the unit that has Velocity is in the arena at the start of the battle step. Units can't gain Stealth after Velocity has already triggered and the change in speed is already in effect. Velocity cannot reduce a unit's speed below 0.
